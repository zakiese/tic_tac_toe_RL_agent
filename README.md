# ♟️ Tic-Tac-Toe AI Agent with Q-Learning

This project implements a Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent that learns to play Tic-Tac-Toe using **Q-learning**, built from scratch with `NumPy` and `Gymnasium`. The agent plays against a random opponent, improves through self-play, and can even play against you!

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Build a Tic-Tac-Toe environment using **Gymnasium**
- Train a Q-learning agent to play optimally
- Evaluate agent performance vs. a random policy
- Let a human user play against the trained agent
